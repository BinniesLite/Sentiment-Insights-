Just kidding, we use Python and it's friends like 
streamlit, pandas, nltk, matplotlib, numpy, catboost, Scikit Learn. 
We also add some Reactjs, material ui and Boostrap to make the project looks more colorful 🌈

## Challenges we ran into
In Python 🐍



## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to say that the AI aka our intelligent AI model with 98% accuracy in determining customer feedbacks
Improve data source from last Hackathon
Create a pie chart that dissect and analyze the customer feed back and produce a pie chart to us

## What we learned


## What's next for Sentiment Insights
We are hoping to demonstrate our product to the user live by communicating data between the front end 
and the AI will deconstruct the feedbacks and determine if the feedback is a positive comment or a negative 
comment. With more time and maybe funding we can set up an API page that business only need to send a bulk of
data to the api and then we will return it with chart that help them summerize all the things they need
